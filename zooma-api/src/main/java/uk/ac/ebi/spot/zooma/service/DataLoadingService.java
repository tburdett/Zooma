 * A service that allows data to be pulled from any available datasources and loaded into ZOOMA.  A "datasource" in this

 * This is a high level interface that abstracts over specific loader implementations.  Implementations of this class
 * can load whichever sets of ZOOMA objects they chose to implement, and can do so in whichever way they chose.  The
 * outcome of using this class should be to take bespoke data and store it in the ZOOMA datasource.  Note that this
 * makes no guarantees about the liveness of this data: indexes may not be dynamically computed so loaded data may not
 * be immediately available in the interface.
