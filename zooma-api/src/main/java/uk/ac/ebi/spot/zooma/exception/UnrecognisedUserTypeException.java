 * This exception is thrown when a has authenticated and registered with ZOOMA but the type of user is not recognised by
 * the wider system, i.e. is not a type of {@link model.ZoomaUser}.  This implies that a user has
 * been successfully authenticated by the spring security stack without corresponding ZOOMA user details, and has
 * therefore never been registered.  This is likely suspicious.
